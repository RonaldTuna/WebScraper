# WebScraper
This repository holds a webscraper that utilizes scrapy to scrape a web application(https://firststop.sos.nd.gov/search/business) for information, and outputs as a .json file. This .json file is then loaded into a Pandas dataframe, cleaned, and used to create a graph with the library NetworkX. The graph is lastly outputted as a .png file using Matplotlib.
